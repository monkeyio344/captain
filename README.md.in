**captain** is a comprehensive development automation tool for Rust workspaces.
It integrates seamlessly as a pre-commit hook and handles repetitive project setup,
code generation, and CI/CD configuration automatically.

> This project was originally forked from [facet-dev](https://github.com/facet-rs/facet-dev).

## Features

captain automates the following tasks:

- **README Generation**: Generates `README.md` files from `README.md.in` templates with customizable headers and footers
- **Code Formatting**: Runs `cargo fmt` to enforce consistent code style
- **Pre-push Verification**: Validates code before pushing (via `captain pre-push`):
  - Runs clippy for linting
  - Executes tests
  - Checks documentation compilation
  - Verifies all crates in workspace
- **MSRV Consistency**: Ensures all crates have the same Minimum Supported Rust Version
- **Rust Documentation**: Auto-generates rustdoc configuration

## Installation

Install captain from crates.io:

```bash
cargo install captain
```

Or build from source:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/bearcove/captain
```

## Usage

### Quick Start

Initialize captain in your project:

```bash
captain init
```

This interactively creates:
- `hooks/` directory with pre-commit and pre-push hooks
- `hooks/install.sh` to install the hooks
- `.conductor/conductor.json` for VS Code task running (optional)
- `README.md.in` template (if not present)

### Basic Generation

Run captain in your workspace root to generate/update all project files:

```bash
captain
```

This will:
1. Generate `README.md` for the workspace and all crates
2. Format code with `cargo fmt`
3. Stage all changes with `git add`

### Pre-push Checks

Before pushing to a remote repository, run:

```bash
captain pre-push
```

This performs comprehensive checks:
- Runs `cargo clippy` on all crates
- Executes `cargo test`
- Validates documentation with `cargo doc`
- Ensures MSRV consistency

### Custom Template Directory

Specify a custom directory for looking up `README.md.in` templates:

```bash
captain --template-dir /path/to/templates
```

This searches for `{crate_name}.md.in` files in the specified directory, falling back
to the crate's own template if not found.

### Debugging

View workspace metadata and package information:

```bash
captain debug-packages
```

## README Template Configuration

### Standard Template Format

Each crate should have a `README.md.in` file in its directory. The generated `README.md`
combines three parts:

1. **Header** (with badges and links)
2. **Main Content** (from `README.md.in`)
3. **Footer** (with license information)

### Custom Header and Footer

To customize the README header and footer templates project-wide, create a `.config/captain/readme-templates`
directory at your workspace root with custom templates:

```bash
.config/captain/readme-templates/
├── readme-header.md
└── readme-footer.md
```

**Header Template Example** (`readme-header.md`):

```markdown
# {CRATE}

[![CI](https://github.com/your-org/{CRATE}/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/your-org/{CRATE}/actions)
[![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/{CRATE}.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/{CRATE})
```

The `{CRATE}` placeholder will be replaced with the actual crate name.

**Footer Template Example** (`readme-footer.md`):

```markdown
## License

Licensed under the MIT License.
```

If these files don't exist, captain uses the built-in default templates.

### Template Priority

For `README.md.in` templates (main content):

1. Custom directory specified via `--template-dir` (if provided)
2. Crate's own `README.md.in` file (in the crate directory)
3. Workspace-level `README.md.in` (for the workspace README)

## Git Hooks Setup

After running `captain init`, install the git hooks:

```bash
./hooks/install.sh
```

This installs hooks that:
- **pre-commit**: Runs `captain` to auto-generate and stage files
- **pre-push**: Runs `captain pre-push` for comprehensive validation

The hooks are installed to the main repo and all worktrees.

## Configuration

captain can be configured via `[package.metadata.captain]` or `[workspace.metadata.captain]` in your `Cargo.toml`. Package metadata takes precedence over workspace metadata.

```toml
# For single-crate projects:
[package.metadata.captain]
generate-readmes = false  # Disable README generation (default: true)
clippy = false            # Disable clippy checks on pre-push

# For workspaces (applies to all crates):
[workspace.metadata.captain]
generate-readmes = false
```

### Available Options

All options default to `true`. Set to `false` to disable.

#### Pre-commit Jobs

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `generate-readmes` | Generate `README.md` files from templates |
| `rustfmt` | Run `cargo fmt` to format code |
| `cargo-lock` | Stage `Cargo.lock` changes |
| `arborium` | Set up arborium syntax highlighting for docs |
| `rust-version` | Enforce consistent MSRV across crates |

#### Pre-push Checks

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `clippy` | Run `cargo clippy` with warnings as errors |
| `nextest` | Run tests via `cargo nextest` |
| `doc-tests` | Run documentation tests |
| `docs` | Build documentation with warnings as errors |
| `cargo-shear` | Check for unused dependencies |

## Notes

### Automatic Staging

When captain runs, it automatically stages all generated files with `git add`.
If captain is updated mid-development, the new changes might appear in an unrelated PR.
This is by design—keep captain stable during active work.

### Workspace Requirements

Your project should:
- Be a Rust workspace or single crate with `Cargo.toml`
- Have git initialized
- Have `README.md.in` template files for any crates you want documented
